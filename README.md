# Covid-19-Viral-Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Transfer-Learning-and-Visualization.
COVID-19 and viral pneumonia are respiratory illnesses that can cause similar symptoms and affect the lungs. 

Many approaches have been developed to improve classification performance and most of them focus on how to extend the layers or the nodes in the Neural Network (NN).
The Proposed Classification Method
Transfer Learning:  Classifiers Models â†’  VGG16, RESNET50.
